## FAQ

### What is the source of `imdb-data-from-2006-to-2016.zip` && `IMDB-Movie-Data.csv` ?

https://www.kaggle.com/PromptCloudHQ/imdb-data

### Your Python source code is weird

That's because it's intented to create Jupyter Notebook easier on Visual Studio Code (also works on VSCodium or Code - OSS). See https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support for more information.

### Why i can't run your Jupyter Notebook or Python source code ?

Either because you use Python older than 3.6 or you didn't install `sklearn` library

### Can i copy your Jupyter Notebook or Python source code ?

Obviously. But beware that some parts are "hard-coded", such as filename, DataFrame index or Series index
